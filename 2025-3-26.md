## Logic of the benchmark
Workload → Instrumentation → Metrics
(What to test) → (How to monitor) → (What to measure)

1. Workload generates realistic test scenarios and agent tasks
2. Instrumentation captures system behavior and events
3. Metrics processes and structures the captured data


### Workload
The Workload module serves as the foundation for generating realistic and reproducible testing scenarios for multi-agent systems. 

### Instrumentation
The Instrumentation module provides non-intrusive mechanisms to monitor and track multi-agent system behavior without significantly altering performance characteristics. It serves as the sensing layer of the benchmark framework, capturing relevant events and measurements across different components.

* **Graph Instrumentation**: Specialized instrumentation for **graph-based agent workflows** like LangGraph, tracking message passing, node execution, and graph traversal patterns. Captures the structural dynamics of agent interactions.
* **LLM Instrumentation**: Monitors LLM-related operations, including prompt construction, token usage, and response processing. Provides hooks for timing API calls and capturing cost metrics while preserving the context of agent operations.
* **Tool Instrumentation**: Tracks agent tool usage, including invocation patterns, parameter distributions, and execution outcomes. Enables analysis of tool effectiveness and agent decision-making.
* **Memory Instrumentation**: Monitors memory operations across agent systems, tracking retrieval patterns, storage efficiency, and memory growth over time. Essential for understanding the long-term performance of agents with memory components.
The Instrumentation module uses strategic interceptors and wrappers that maintain the semantic equivalence of instrumented and non-instrumented code, ensuring that measurements accurately reflect natural system behavior while providing comprehensive visibility into operations.


### Metrics
The Metrics module defines the data collection, processing, and storage infrastructure for capturing multi-agent system performance data. It establishes a uniform metrics model that enables cross-system comparisons while accommodating domain-specific measurements.

* **System Metrics**: Collects system-level performance indicators including throughput, latency distributions, resource utilization, and overall system stability. Provides a macroscopic view of multi-agent performance.
* **Agent Metrics**: Focuses on individual agent performance metrics such as token usage, tool utilization patterns, decision-making efficiency, and memory operations. Enables fine-grained analysis of agent behavior and optimization opportunities.
* **Inter-Agent Metrics**: Captures communication patterns, coordination overhead, and interaction dynamics between agents. Essential for understanding emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems and identifying collaboration bottlenecks.
* **Collectors**: Implements the core collection infrastructure with efficient, thread-safe mechanisms for gathering, buffering, and processing metrics. Includes configurable sampling strategies to balance measurement accuracy and overhead.
The Metrics module employs queue-based processing with configurable batch sizes and sampling rates to efficiently handle high volumes of metrics data while minimizing impact on the measured system.
