"""
Graph Instrumentation for Multi-Agent System Benchmark Framework

This module provides specialized instrumentation for graph-based agent workflows,
particularly focusing on LangGraph and similar architectures. It enables monitoring
of message flow, node execution patterns, and system traversal dynamics.

Key Capabilities:
1. Node Execution Tracking: Measures time spent in each graph node
2. Edge Transition Monitoring: Tracks the flow of messages between nodes
3. Graph Traversal Analysis: Captures the execution paths through the graph
4. State Evolution Tracking: Monitors how state changes as it flows through the graph
5. Checkpoint Performance: Measures time spent on state serialization/deserialization

Implementation Strategy:
The GraphInstrumenter works by wrapping LangGraph nodes and edges with monitoring code
that preserves their original behavior while adding timing and state tracking capabilities.
It uses a decorator pattern to maintain the semantic equivalence of instrumented and
non-instrumented code.

Collected Metrics:
- Node execution time
- Edge transition frequency
- Graph traversal patterns
- State size evolution
- Execution path distribution
- Node error rates
- Message throughput by node/edge
