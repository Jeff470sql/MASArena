"""
Memory Instrumentation for Multi-Agent System Benchmark Framework

This module provides specialized instrumentation for memory operations within 
multi-agent systems. It captures detailed metrics about memory access patterns,
storage efficiency, retrieval effectiveness, and growth characteristics.

Key Capabilities:
1. Memory Access Tracking: Monitors read/write operations across memory systems
2. Size Monitoring: Tracks the growth of memory storage over time
3. Retrieval Analysis: Measures the effectiveness of memory retrieval operations
4. Contention Detection: Identifies competing access to shared memory resources
5. Memory Utilization: Assesses the efficiency of memory usage in agent operations

Implementation Strategy:
The MemoryInstrumenter works by intercepting memory operations in various memory
systems (vectorstores, key-value stores, graph memories, etc.) while preserving
their original functionality. It is designed to work with LangChain, LlamaIndex,
and custom memory implementations.

Collected Metrics:
- Memory operation counts by type (read/write/update/delete)
- Memory size growth over time
- Retrieval latency and hit rates
- Memory contention events and resolution times
- Storage efficiency metrics
- Memory fragmentation indicators
- Semantic drift tracking (for long-running systems)
