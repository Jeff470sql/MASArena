"""
LLM Instrumentation for Multi-Agent System Benchmark Framework

This module provides specialized instrumentation for Large Language Model interactions
within multi-agent systems. It captures detailed metrics about prompt construction,
token usage, inference time, and response processing.

Key Capabilities:
1. Token Usage Tracking: Measures input and output tokens for cost analysis
2. Inference Time Monitoring: Captures LLM API latency and processing time
3. Prompt Analysis: Tracks prompt construction patterns and effectiveness
4. Response Processing: Monitors how agents process LLM outputs
5. Error Handling: Tracks error rates and types in LLM interactions

Implementation Strategy:
The LLMInstrumenter works by intercepting LLM API calls from popular libraries
like LangChain and LlamaIndex, capturing metrics before and after the call while
preserving the original functionality. It supports major providers including
OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models.

Collected Metrics:
- Input/output token counts
- Token cost by model
- Prompt construction time
- API call latency
- Response processing time
- Cache hit rates (if applicable)
- Error rates by error type
- Token efficiency ratios
- Local deployment model metrics (system cost ...)
