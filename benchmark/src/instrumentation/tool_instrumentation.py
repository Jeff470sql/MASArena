"""
Tool Instrumentation for Multi-Agent System Benchmark Framework

This module provides specialized instrumentation for tool usage within multi-agent
systems. It captures detailed metrics about tool invocation patterns, execution time,
success rates, and resource utilization.

Key Capabilities:
1. Tool Usage Tracking: Monitors which tools are used, how often, and by which agents
2. Execution Time Measurement: Captures the time spent in different tool operations
3. Parameter Analysis: Tracks patterns in tool parameter usage
4. Success Rate Monitoring: Records successful vs. failed tool executions
5. Resource Utilization: Measures computational resources consumed during tool use

Implementation Strategy:
The ToolInstrumenter works by wrapping tool functions with monitoring code that
preserves their original behavior while adding timing and usage tracking capabilities.
It supports various tool frameworks including LangChain tools, custom functions, and
external API calls.

Collected Metrics:
- Tool invocation frequency by agent and tool type
- Tool execution time distributions
- Parameter patterns and common values
- Success/failure rates by tool type
- Resource utilization during tool execution
- Tool dependency chains and sequences
- Concurrent tool usage patterns
