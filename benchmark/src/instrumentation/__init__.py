"""
Instrumentation Module for Multi-Agent System Benchmark Framework

This module provides non-intrusive monitoring capabilities for multi-agent systems,
capturing detailed performance data without significantly altering the system behavior.
It serves as the sensing layer of the benchmark framework, tracking operations across
different components of multi-agent architectures.

Key Components:
- Graph Instrumentation: Monitors graph-based agent workflows
- LLM Instrumentation: Tracks language model interactions
- Tool Instrumentation: Observes agent tool usage patterns
- Memory Instrumentation: Measures memory operations and efficiency

The instrumentation is designed to be lightweight and configurable, allowing users
to selectively enable monitoring for specific components while maintaining
performance characteristics close to the uninstrumented system.
