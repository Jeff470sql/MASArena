# Meeting Notes 2025.03.12

### Completed Tasks

- Investigated related work on adaptive reasoning; token range control remains suboptimal.
- Built Supervisor MAS and support token tracking in LangSmith.

### Takeaways

- The current objective is to analyze the impact of reasoning models on existing architectures and identify suitable structures for them.
- Developed a MAS framework to integrate various benchmark pipelines for future scalability.

### Remaining Issues

- Thinking token control is not ideal.

- Analyze architecture, model selection, and benchmark criteria to assess the impact of reasoning models.
- Methods like GPT-Swarm and AFlow optimize computational graphs with action-based nodes, which do not align well with the team's vision. Agent-verse uses agents as nodes.

### Todo

- [ ] MAS Architecture Modification:
  - [ ] Adjust architecture: Initially allocate tasks and agents to several models, then allow agents to form teams or replicate.
- [ ] Benchmark Integration:
  - [ ] Implement the first `Math` benchmark pipeline based on the `BaseBenchmark` class.
  - [ ] Develop support for additional benchmarks.
- [ ] Reasoning Model Workflow Exploration:
  - [ ] Experiment with AFlow / GPT-Swarm and replace models with reasoning models.
  - [ ] Explore agent hierarchy and architecture to finalize the MAS structure.
  - [ ] Identify reasoning models that support thinking token field extraction.
